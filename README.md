Jira Performance Tests (JPT) is a fully-automated performance benchmarking tool designed for Jira Server and Jira Data Center.
It can manage all aspects of the testing process -- provisioning a new Jira instance, running performance tests, and generating
a report.

JPT focuses on _user experience_, allowing you to test both front-end and back-end performance simultaneously. Rather than
using simple HTTP traffic, JPT uses browsers to test end-to-end interactions.

Atlassian maintains and uses JPT to benchmark Jira's performance each release (see [Scaling Jira](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/scaling-jira-867028644.html) for details).
If you're an Atlassian developer, you can access their [internal JPT tests](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/JIRASERVER/repos/jira-performance-tests/browse/README.md)
using your employee credentials.
